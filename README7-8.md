##Weekly Reports

###Week Seven

With the presentation coming up next week all I worked on was that. All of my other projects suffered from this, but I have made this commitment to the company and will not let anything stand in the way of that. The preparation for the pitch was very successful, with both the cinematic trailer and in game trailer being completed, plus a great set of slides. Though I did want there to be more emphasis on gameplay in the presentation I was overruled and couldn't do anything about it as I had to be away for the weekend. Though I'm sure the others will learn in time.  

###Week Eight

The presentation went well, we were the most professional team to present, though the feedback proved my point of more gameplay was needed. I believe if that was included we may have won. Plus if we had it released on Itch.io, though it is over now and I can resume my work on the other projects. The AI has made a large leap now, all it needs is an array of target points and to get the closest one to the player then to move to that one. The client project is at a stand still, nothing is being done about it, and I don't believe that it will be ready by any means. This is the issue when a small group of people is asked to do two major projects with some commercial viability. The marking scheme needs to be reformed to better suit working beside the BA's.
